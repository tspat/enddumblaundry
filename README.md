## Customization

### Video:
To embed a youtube video:
```jsx
import React from 'react'
import ReactPlayer from 'react-player'
// Render a YouTube video player instead of local file
<ReactPlayer url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysz5S6PUM-U' />
```

Otherwise embed from source in public folder.

### Client Config

AppConfig.ts customizes the following:

```
 site_name: 'Partnership with Company Name',
  title: 'Tumble Partnership.', 
  description: 'Our Proposal To you',
  locale: 'en',
  owner: 'Clarified Inc. DBA Tumble.',
```


See [react-player](https://github.com/cookpete/react-player) for more on video customizations




## Deploy to production

You can see the results locally in production mode with:

```
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```

The generated HTML and CSS files are minified (built-in feature from Next js). It will also removed unused CSS from [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

You can create an optimized production build with:

```
npm run build-prod
```

Now, your theme is ready to be deployed. All generated files are located at `out` folder, which you can deploy with any hosting service.


## Deploy to Vercel

Deploy this Next JS Boilerplate on Vercel in one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fixartz%2FNext-JS-Landing-Page-Starter-Template)

## VSCode information (optional)

If you are VSCode users, you can have a better integration with VSCode by installing the suggested extension in `.vscode/extension.json`. The starter code comes up with Settings for a seamless integration with VSCode. The Debug configuration is also provided for frontend and backend debugging experience.

Pro tips: if you need a project wide type checking with TypeScript, you can run a build with <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> on Mac.
